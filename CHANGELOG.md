# Changelog

## Release — r12.24.1

Internal version: `2026.10.03-r12.24.1`

Major navigation-stability release for the Legacy / TV interface.

- Adds per-row navigation memory:
  - a row visited for the first time starts on its first card
  - returning to a previously visited row restores that row's own selected card
  - each row also restores its own horizontal Jellyfin carousel position
- Uses Jellyfin's native `emby-scroller` APIs for horizontal movement, including transform-mode carousels, so Left/Right movement no longer depends on plain `scrollLeft`.
- Keeps vertical page position isolated from horizontal carousel movement.
- Improves Home lazy loading:
  - rapid repeated Down keeps one pending move alive
  - same-route Home DOM replacement no longer cancels the pending move
  - newly mounted rows are recovered by stable media identity
- Refines SeerrFin Discover navigation:
  - Movies, Shows, and Settings form one logical TV-control row
  - Requests is skipped by D-pad navigation
  - Down enters the first media row without scrolling the Discover controls
- Jellyfin Search now buffers TV-keyboard input locally and does not trigger Jellyfin search until the on-screen **SEARCH** button is pressed.
- Jellyfin Enhanced request flows now support both the initial Request / Request More control and the final request confirmation button.
- Focus-ring handoff is immediate during rapid navigation so a valid selection does not disappear between animation frames.
- JellyMark navigation is hierarchical:
  - content / controls → active Watchlist sub-tab
  - sub-tab → main Watchlist tab
  - short Back on the main Watchlist tab does nothing
  - long Back remains Universal Home
- Adds hardware-sensitive Back handling so delayed keyup events from CEC/remapped remotes are not misread as a Watchlist long press without actual repeat events.
- Preserves 900 ms hold Enter / OK refresh and 900 ms hold Back / Escape Universal Home outside the Watchlist timing guard.
- Maintains player OSD, ActionSheet, Enhanced pause-screen, Details Play/Resume, native library, SeerrFin grid, and Universal Home behavior from earlier stable releases.
- Compatible with the independent JellyMark project, including JellyMark 3.2.2's persistent top-level Watchlist tab and delegated Back ownership.

## Release — r12.19

Internal version: `2026.09.30-r12.19-jellymark-compatibility`

First release under the **JellyNav** name.

- Restores the fully tested JellyMark compatibility layer from staging while keeping JellyMark completely independent.
- JellyNav automatically recognizes JellyMark's Watchlist UI when both projects are installed; neither project is required by the other.
- Adds deterministic remote navigation across JellyMark's main Watchlist tab, sub-tabs, filters, Watch History, Statistics, dialogs, and Series Progress.
- Series Progress uses one logical selection per series row: the whole row is outlined, the Mark Watched / Mark Unplayed action is outlined at the same time, and Enter activates that action.
- Preserves the active-main-tab Back fix so returning from sub-areas highlights the section actually on screen instead of a stale previous tab.
- Keeps short Back/Escape inert on top-level tabs while sub-areas return to their parent section.
- Preserves 900 ms hold Enter/OK refresh and 900 ms hold Back/Escape Universal Home.
- Includes the r12.18 performance work: cached visual geometry, reduced duplicate DOM scans, and dirty-state caching for Watchlist/native-library navigation models.
- Rebrands user-facing documentation and console logging as JellyNav.
- Documents JellyNav as one independent component of the larger **JellyPi** project alongside JellyMark.
## Release — r12.18.1

Internal version: `2026.09.30-r12.18.1`

Major Legacy/TV navigation and performance release.

- Promotes the optimized staging navigation architecture to `main`.
- Short Back/Escape is now parent-aware:
  - top-level Home / Movies / Shows / Requests tabs do nothing on short Back
  - sub-areas return to their owning main tab or parent area
  - downloaded Movies and Shows libraries are treated as Home subsections and return Home
  - Details opened from a main section restore that section instead of relying on stale browser history
- Main-tab focus now resolves from the actually active Jellyfin tab before falling back to remembered ancestry, preventing stale selection highlights after switching between tabs.
- Long-press behavior remains unchanged:
  - hold Enter / OK for 900 ms to refresh
  - hold Back / Escape for 900 ms for Universal Home
- Player behavior includes:
  - hidden-OSD Enter pause/resume behavior
  - player ActionSheet navigation for subtitles, audio, and settings
  - Jellyfin Enhanced pause-screen recovery
  - startup shielding so the previous page is not exposed while the player mounts
- Details now prefer visible Play / Resume on entry and restore that selection after returning from playback.
- Universal Home was hardened for late SPA mounts and same-route plugin states.
- Native downloaded-library navigation, SeerrFin grids, Home, Details, player controls, dialogs, and headers received broad performance optimization.
- Repeated layout work was reduced by caching element geometry during visual sorting.
- Duplicate DOM scans and header/card rebuilds were removed where possible.
- Native-library navigation models now rebuild only when their DOM changes instead of on every D-pad press.
- The public build intentionally excludes unreleased companion-integration code. A separate companion integration is planned and will be documented when ready.

## Maintenance — r12.12.2

Internal version: `2026.09.30-r12.12.2-seerr-grid-navigation`

Legacy/TV SeerrFin grid correction.

- SeerrFin provider/network browse grids now start on the **first real card** once asynchronous card loading completes instead of preserving the temporary Back selection from the empty grid shell.
- D-pad movement in these grids now scrolls the **actual Jellyfin page** to keep the selected card and Load More button visible.
- Moving back to grid/header chrome scrolls the page back to the top.
- Universal Home (hold Back/Escape) now closes an active same-page SeerrFin grid through SeerrFin's own Back control before continuing the normal Home action.
- This maintenance pass was applied to the stable Legacy/TV branch only; Modern UI development remains separate.

## Maintenance — r12.12.1

Internal version: `2026.09.30-r12.12.1-home-seerr-maintenance`

Stable maintenance update on top of the accepted r12.12 architecture.

- Home now prefers Media Bar **Play** as its startup/return selection and retries while Media Bar mounts.
- Home keeps a temporary visible fallback selection instead of loading with no focus.
- A real D-pad input cancels the Home startup retry so late plugin rendering cannot steal focus.
- SeerrFin full-grid/provider pages now automatically claim the first poster and include the grid Back button, top tabs, all loaded cards, and Load More in D-pad navigation.
- Details explicitly prefer Jellyfin's visible `.mainDetailButtons .btnPlay` Play/Resume control on entry.
- The same fixes were carried to the Modern development branch.

## Final — r12.12

Internal version: `2026.09.29-r12.12-auto-context-focus`

Final accepted build.

Highlights:

- Automatically re-resolves navigation context when Jellyfin mounts new UI.
- Prevents stale/ghost focus from remaining visible behind newly opened overlays.
- Native Jellyfin dialogs now claim navigation focus automatically.
- Restores the underlying context when supported overlays close.
- Preserves the single-ring far-jump focus animation from r12.11.
- Preserves native Media Bar `window.slideshowPure` integration.

## r12.11

- Replaced multi-layer focus handoff effects with one real focus ring.
- Large jumps use a short opacity/glow arrival.
- Nearby navigation remains immediate.
- Removed cloned/scaled focus rectangles that could fight Jellyfin scrolling/layout.

## r12.10

- Limited the stronger focus effect to far-distance navigation.
- Superseded by the simpler r12.11 focus architecture.

## r12.9

- Experimented with a stronger focus pop/overshoot.
- Rejected because applying the effect too broadly made ordinary navigation feel busy.

## r12.8

- Removed obsolete Media Bar Enhanced assumptions.
- Integrated with the actual Media Bar plugin through `window.slideshowPure`.
- Preserved fixes for late Home rows and native library initial focus.

## r12.7

- Experimented with source/destination focus handoff animation.
- Later replaced by the single-ring design.

## r12.6

- Improved Home row settling after Media Bar navigation.
- Improved initial Movies/TV library focus.
- Included an earlier focus-transition experiment.

## r12.5 and earlier

Development builds that established the core navigation model, detail-page behavior, SeerrFin handling, native library navigation, player controls, and long-press remote actions.

Older source revisions remain available in Git history rather than the final working tree.
